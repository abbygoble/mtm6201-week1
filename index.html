        Hello, my name is Abigail but I prefer to go by Abby.   I'm from a small town called Lakefield just outside of Peterborough, Ontario.  I grew up figure skating, doing highland dance, and singing in various choirs.  I love dogs and have a 2 year old Pomeranian poodle at home that I miss dearly since moving to Ottawa.

        I am a second semester Interactive Media Design student here at Algonquin College.  Prior to this program I took Aesthetics at Fleming College, but decided after working in the industry for a year that my interests lie elsewhere, and enrolled in this program.  I'm excited to learn more and become a part of this fascinating industry!
